# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project for detecting credit card fraud using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with Python, MiniSom, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Self-Organizing Maps. SOMs are an unsupervised learning method used to visualize and interpret complex data patterns.

## Features

- Implements Self-Organizing Maps for anomaly detection
- Utilizes MiniSom for SOM implementation
- Data processing with Pandas and NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
